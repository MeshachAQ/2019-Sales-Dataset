# INTRODUCTION
Hello And Welcome. In Today’s Presentation, I Am Excited To Take You Through This 2019 Sales Dataset.
I Am Really Excited To Be Doing This Presentation As It Has Given Me The Opportunity To Dive Into, And Gain Insightful Information About This Special Project

# ABOUT dataset
Hola, My Name Is Quansah Abaidoo Meshach, A Data Analyst And I Am Here Today To Take Us Through This Wonderful Presentation.
This dataset comprised of 4 files for four different months starting January 2019 through to April 2019 and management is asking us to work out somethings with this data to help make informed decisions so yes. 
Thank you

# PROCESS
I am excited to state that, I took the necessary steps to ensure this process has been cleaned properly before finally arriving at the final result.
### Firstly, I got this dataset from Kaggle and downloaded it.
### Secondly, I extracted the file and named it 2019 sales dataset on my computer and since it had a number of same files, I decided to then save everything I extracted into one folder so I can just combine the whole CSV file in power bi.
### Thirdly, after saving the whole file in one folder, about 4 csv files I extracted, into one folder, I named it again as 2019 sales data set.
### I then opened power Bi to start work. So I exported the whole folder containing the files from my desktop to power bi and then chose the combine and transform data option.
### After choosing to combine all the files in the folder as one, I needed to do a little transforming before anything else in order to make my visualization work easy. So I decided to clean the data, I checked for duplicates, null or blank values and removed then. 
### I then had to standardize the date column. After which I decided to split the purchase address column into purchase address street, city and address.

# Recommendations
1. The data highlights the ThinkPad Laptop as a strong performer within the Bottom 5 products, suggesting that targeted marketing and inventory strategies could further capitalize on its success. At the same time, it is crucial to address the factors 
   affecting the performance of lower-ordered products like the LG Dryer to achieve a more balanced product portfolio.
2. The strong performance of AAA Batteries (4-pack) should be leveraged through enhanced marketing and inventory strategies. Addressing the performance of Wired Headphones and adjusting inventory levels based on demand will help in optimizing overall 
   product sales and achieving a balanced portfolio.
3. The strong performance in February should be leveraged to enhance overall sales strategies, while addressing the factors contributing to lower order volumes in months like May. By optimizing inventory and marketing strategies based on monthly 
   performance trends, you can improve sales consistency and drive better results across all months.
4. By leveraging the success of high-order days like Tuesday and addressing the factors contributing to lower order volumes on days like Thursday, you can optimize overall sales and inventory management. Implementing targeted promotions and adjusting 
   inventory based on weekday performance will help enhance sales consistency throughout the week.
5. By leveraging the strong performance in San Francisco and addressing the factors affecting lower sales in cities like Austin, you can optimize sales strategies and resource allocation. Tailoring marketing efforts and continuously monitoring sales 
   trends will help enhance performance across all cities and drive overall growth.
6. By capitalizing on the strong performance of the Macbook Pro Laptop and addressing the factors contributing to the lower sales of products like the 34in Ultrawide Monitor, you can enhance overall sales performance. Optimizing inventory, marketing 
   strategies, and product positioning will help drive growth and improve sales across all products.
7. Based on the sales data from the four-month period in 2019, where March experienced the highest sales, followed by February, April, and January with the lowest sales, it is recommended to focus marketing and inventory efforts on the peak months of 
  March and February. Consider analyzing the factors contributing to the strong performance in these months and replicate similar strategies. Additionally, investigate the minimal data from May to determine if it indicates an opportunity for growth or 
  requires further attention.
8. Given that the LG Dryer led the Bottom 5 products with a total sales figure of $7,200, significantly outperforming the AAA Batteries (4-pack) at $2,145, it is recommended to focus on optimizing the sales strategy for high-performing products like the 
   LG Dryer. Leverage its success through targeted promotions and expanded visibility. For the lower-performing products, such as the AAA Batteries (4-pack), investigate factors contributing to their lower sales and implement strategies to boost their 
   performance, such as adjusting pricing, enhancing marketing efforts, or reevaluating their market positioning.
9. Since March achieved the highest total sales of $202,110.60 and exhibited a strong positive correlation with the quantity ordered, it is advisable to capitalize on the strategies that contributed to March's success. Analyze and replicate these 
   effective tactics to boost sales in other months. Additionally, address the disparity in March, where total sales exceeded quantity ordered by $200,924.60, to understand and balance this divergence. For months with lower sales, like May, implement 
   targeted marketing and sales strategies to enhance performance and better align with the successful practices observed in March.
